# Project Proposal

This software would help with the spread of information by allowing the users to be constantly up to date on what risks they could be in entering the cities that they are traveling to. When you enter a city the software will tell you whether or not you are in COVID hotspot, what the infection rates in this city is, and what precautions you should take to avoid contracting the virus. This will be a mobile app that will be connected to the userâ€™s contacts and if they have contracted COVID they will be able to access a list of contacts that the app will send an alert to in case they came into contact with one of them. This will advise people to get tested to help prevent the spread of the virus.
